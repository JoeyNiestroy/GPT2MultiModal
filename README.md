A pretrained CLIP-Vit-base model and GPT2-large model are the base vison and LM. Input images are proccessed first by the CLIP model then normalized and pass to a single transfomer layer before being added to the token embeddings. A special `<image>` token/embedding was added to the vocab and typcal inputs are formated as such " Q:  (50*`<image>`) How many people are in this image? A: 3 " The image token is repeated to match the shape of the image embeddings so that the two tensors can be added together. 

The total paramaters of the model are **<1 Billion**

##  Training Methods ## 

First part of training used base causal language modeling objective, to avoid issues seen in early training only the answer tokens were used to calculate loss. A subset of the 2017 VQA dataset was used.  ${\color{green}\text{Currently 100k/100k samples, First Epoch}}$

The second part of training will include RL with PPO with a basic reward model based off if the model correctly identified the answer. Sentence similarity failed for automated reward modeling for this task (Ex: Words Red and Black are high similar tokens, but for visual question answering one is correct one is not) , so currently tagging data myself, and planning to adapt model for automating this process. Also exploring using CLIP style models as reward models for generated image descriptions  ${\color{red} \text{Up-coming} }$

Finally the model will be trained off LLava Dataset for desciptive and longer form replies ${\color{red} \text{Up-coming} }$
